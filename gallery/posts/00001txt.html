  <p> I'm not exactly sure what I'm going to put here yet. Could it be a place to put
  cool things that I find? Alternatively I could use it as a place to showcase my work. Maybe I could make it a blend of the two in some way? <br><br> Anyways,
  check out this old building at the intersection between Union Street and Congress Street. It used to be the Athens Post Office,
  before it was bought by Ohio University. Now it stores office spaces!
  Convenient for the university, less so for everybody else.</p>
  If you live where I do you should recognize it:
