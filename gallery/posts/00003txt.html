<p>I’ve released an EP called <i>Dark Waves</i>. It’s pretty short, with a run time of about 13 minutes. </p>

<p>It’s the third “installation” (for lack of a better term) of my self-imposed 3 day EPs challenge, in which I produce a little musical project within a 3 day time period. I slightly cheated this time, as part of the fourth track had been written a few months ago. I felt that it fit the album though, so I allowed it.</p>

<p>Here’s a link to it on <a href="https://leodebatin.bandcamp.com/album/dark-waves" target="_blank" class="class2 ">Bandcamp</a>. You can buy it for any amount you want there, or you could just directly download it from the <a href="../../download.html" target="_blank" class="class2 ">Downloads</a> page. My two other EP’s are located there as well.</p>

<p>My favorite songs from this project are “Curl of the Wave” and “Soul Garden”. <br> The former can be played below:</p> <br>
