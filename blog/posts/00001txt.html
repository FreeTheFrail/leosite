<p>I originally created this website at the start of fall last year, but the majority of the time that I spent working on this site was absorbed by me learning HTML and CSS. By doing this I was able to make the website more visually compelling,
  but it distracted me from making any real blog posts. In an attempt to remedy this, last summer I decided to completely remodel the site, taking on a more stripped back approach. Still, the site has laid in a mostly idle state since those changes.

I don’t think the time I spent on the original site was a waste. Since I had already created the older site, I was able to set this one up within a few hours. I’m not sure how long it’s going to be until I make a blog post that talks about something outside of the bounds of this 4 paged static website, but I'm hoping that within the next few months I'll have posted a couple of thoughts. I currently have at least a baker's dozen of half-baked ideas, so I have plenty to talk about. It's hard to choose which subject to start with though, and I think my inability to choose is why it's taken me so long to post. Hopefully this post will soften that pressure.
