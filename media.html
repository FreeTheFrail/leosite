    <P>This is my media page. I'm not exactly sure what I'm going to post here yet,
      but it'll probably be a mix of music and art as well as some other things I create on my computer. Might make a computer game sometime too.</p>
    <p>Also one of the few limitations with using github to host websites is that they don't allow people to upload files
    that are larger than 25MB, so I'll probably be using different websites to host the downloads for my larger projects.</p>

    <p>Here's a little EP I made in the winter of 2020:</p> <a href="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1aI1LI_67Kmpkf5xR6kTlaSnJ5FFNa0rG" download>Download</a>
