    <p>To me, websites are one of the best forms of media. At least if they are done right.
       I’m not talking about social websites like Facebook or Instagram, I mean static, simple websites that have a strong purpose.
       They kind of feel like what books should have evolved into at the turn of the 21st century.
       I’ll probably write about this in more detail on my first blog post.</p>

    <p>Currently my site is divided into 4 sections: the <a href="index.html">Home</a> page, the <a href="blog/blog.html">Blog</a> page, the <a href="media.html">Media</a> page, and the <a href="about.html">About/Links</a> page.
       The hompage will likely be where I post updates about my website and where I put up random information like my favorite song of the week.
       My media page will likely consist of random art I that make while messing around, as well as some larger projects too.
       My blog page, which will likely be the most active page, is where I’m going to write about things that I consider imporant.
       The final page of this site is this page, which is where you can learn about this site, as well as where I'll put links that I think are important.
       I might add more pages in the future, but these four should be adequate for now.</p>

    <p>If you somehow found this website and you’re reading this, I would suggest that you create your own website too.
       There are a few ways to do this (at least that i’m aware of, there’s definitely got to be other ways too).
       The best way, but probably(?) the most difficult way would be to host your website directly from your own internet.
       I didn’t use this method, so I would recommend you send an email to <a href="mailto:sam@samdebatin.com" target="_blank">this guy</a> for more information.
       Or you can always ask the internet. The second way, which is the method I used, is to use <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a> to host your website files and <a href="https://netlify.com" target="_blank">Netlify</a> to build your site.
       You can email me <a href="mailto:leosdebatin@gmail.com" target="_blank">here</a> if you need help with this. The final way of hosting is to use <a href="https://wordpress.com" target="_blank">Wordpress</a>,
       but personally I’m not a fan of their services as 1) they will put watermarks on your page unless you give money to them and
       2) wordpress sites can be kind of clunky as they don't gives you much control over your website. It’s still worth using if you have no alternative though.</p>

    <p>I also suggest you read <a href="https://wtf.tw/ref/duckett.pdf" target="_blank">this book</a> to learn HTML, as well as use your browser's inspect element tool to see the techniques that other websites use.
       You’ll also want to buy a domain for your website, and I would suggest <a href="https://namecheap.com/ "target="_blank">Namecheap</a> for doing that.</p>
    <p>Anyways, thats all I really have to say about my website as of now. Feel free to check out some of the links below.</p>
