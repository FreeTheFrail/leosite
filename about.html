<p>I created this blog in the latter half of 2021 with the intention of posting my thoughts. Since then it has remained fairly bare, but I’m hoping by early 2023 it will be much more populated with ideas.
  I am planning to post music, art, and writings, as well anything else I think would fit. I’m not exactly sure how I want to organize this site yet, so it may take a while before much shows up. This all depends on how motivated I am on the site.</p>
<p>Eventually I would also like to post some programs I create, if I find them interesting enough for people to want to check out. I expect it will be a while before I get around to doing that.
There is one program that i've been working on for a while, but my interests lay elsewhere at the moment.</p>

<p>This site is divided into 5 primary sections: Download, Blog, Home, Gallery, and About. You can access all of these at top of the site. <br>
- The DOWNLOAD page will be where you can access important downloads. Currently empty; I might change it to lead to a different page if I don't feel the need for it.<br>
- The BLOG page will be where I publish some of my more formalized thoughts, typically about various topics that I think about frequently. <br>
- The HOME page will remain fairly static throughout this sites existence, though the notes section will likely change frequently. There will also probably be a showcase of something from the gallery page on the homepage. Unlike it's text based counterparts, this page is accessed by clicking on the icon situated between the blog and gallery buttons.<br>
- The GALLERY section is probably the most abstract of the pages. On it I plant to post about art, architecture, writings, and anything else visual that interests me. With this I will offer an explanation of it and explain why I think its cool. I’ll be posting some of my own work there too. <br>
- The ABOUT page should be pretty self explanatory if you’ve gotten this far into the page, but generally speaking this is where I will explain aspects of this website. This page also hosts a few links at the bottom. <br> </p>

<p>About me: I am currently a sophomore in college living in the southeast area of the memetic Ohioland. I’m studying music production at the moment, and am considering minors in art history and english.
  A creative writing double major may happen too, but I’m not certain if my schedule would allow for that yet. I should probably figure that out soon.</p>
<p>Some of my interests include: art, writing, music, walking, exploring, rain, sitting in uncommon places, dance (and general rhytmic movement, if thats any different), architecture, movies,
  religion (though I don’t follow any), programming, pop culture absurdism, history, and searching for rarities. </p>
