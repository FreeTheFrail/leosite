<p>I created this blog in the latter half of 2021 with the intention of posting my thoughts. At the moment the site is fairly bare, but I’m hoping by early 2023 it will be much more populated with ideas.
  I am planning to post writings, art, and  music. I’m not exactly sure how I want to organize this site yet, so it may take a while to get those out, depending on how motivated I am on the site.</p>
<p>Eventually I would also like to post some programs I create, if I find them interesting enough for people to want to check out. I expect it will be a while before I get around to doing that (though
  there is one thing that could be finished fairly soon if I regain my interest in it.)</p>

<p>This site is divided into 4 parts: Home, Blog, Gallery, and About. I might add a downloads page. <br>
- The HOME page will remain fairly static throughout this sites existence, though the notes section will likely change frequently. There will also probably be a showcase of something from the gallery page on the homepage. <br>
- The BLOG page will be where I publish some of my more formalized thoughts, typically about various topics that I think about frequently. <br>
- The GALLERY section is probably the most abstract of the pages. On it I plant to post about art, architecture, writings, and anything else visual that interests me. With this I will offer an explanation of it and explain why I think its cool. I’ll be posting some of my own work there too. <br>
- The ABOUT page should be pretty self explanatory if you’ve gotten this far into the page, but generally speaking this is where I will explain aspects of this website. This page also hosts a few links at the bottom. <br> </p>

<p>About me: I am currently a sophomore in college living in the southeast area of the now semi-viral Ohioland. I’m studying music production at the moment, and am considering minors in art history and english.
  A creative writing double major may happen too, but I’m not certain if my schedule would allow for that yet. I should probably figure that out soon.</p>
<p>Some of my interests include: art, writing, music, walking, exploring, rain, sitting in uncommon places, dance (and general movement, if thats any different), architecture, movies,
  religion (though I don’t follow any), programming, pop culture absurdism, history, and searching for rarities. </p>
