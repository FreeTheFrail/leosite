    <p><i><u>Truman Show Edit - Tue 8 Nov 2022</u></i></p>
    <p> Here's an edit of a scene from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Truman_Show" target="_blank">The Truman Show</a> that I created for my History of Film Music class this semester. I have replaced the original soundtrack of the film (written by Phillip Glass) with
      the song "Have You Got It In You" by Imogen Heap. I've also manipulated the coloring throughout the clip.<br> </p>

    <p><i><u>Old Athens Post Office - Mon 7 Nov 2022</u></i></p>
    <p> I'm not exactly sure what I'm going to put here yet. Maybe it could just be a place to put
    cool things that I find? Alternatively I could use it as a place to showcase my work. Maybe I could make it a blend of the two in some way? <br><br> Anyways,
    check out this old building at the intersection between Union Street and Congress Street. It used to be the Athens Post Office,
    before it was bought by Ohio University. Now it stores: office spaces!
    Convenient for the university, less so for everyone else.</p>
    Some of you may recognize it.
